## What's up! How are you going?
Welcome to my profile. I'm a begineer developer on workspace and I've been programming since 2019.
Take a look at section below, I will talk more about myself! :eyes:

### What are your programming statistics?
I learned Java (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/195/PNG/256/Java_23404.png" width="10" height="10">) language to make my plugins in Bukkit. After few months, Lua (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/512/PNG/512/prog-lua02_icon-icons.com_50785.png" width="10" height="10">) was the first language where I made games in Roblox Studio. I also have a little knowledge in languages like Kotlin (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2107/PNG/512/file_type_kotlin_icon_130487.png" width="10" height="10">), Javascript (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2108/PNG/512/javascript_icon_130900.png" width="10" height="10">) and C (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2415/PNG/512/c_original_logo_icon_146611.png" width="10" height="10">).
