## What's up! How are you?

Welcome to my profile. I'm a begineer developer on workspace and I have been programming with this for an one year.
Take a look at section below, I will talk more about myself! :eyes:

### What are your programming statistics?

So, I have been programming some languages since I started learning to program. In my first month, I learned Java (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/195/PNG/256/Java_23404.png" width="10" height="10">) language to make my plugins in Bukkit. After few months, I learned Lua (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/512/PNG/512/prog-lua02_icon-icons.com_50785.png" width="10" height="10">) language to make some games in Roblox Studio (That was pretty funny!). Other languages like Kotlin (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2107/PNG/512/file_type_kotlin_icon_130487.png" width="10" height="10">), Javascript (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2108/PNG/512/javascript_icon_130900.png" width="10" height="10">) and C (<img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2415/PNG/512/c_original_logo_icon_146611.png" width="10" height="10">) I learned with time.
