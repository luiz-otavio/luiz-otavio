# What's up! How's going?
I think it's not your first time seeing that, but I like it.
It's kinda cool if we got more numbers about profile views :D!

# About me
I like things such as programming, languages, data-science and DevOps since August in 2019.
To be honest, I wanna increase my programming skills in good environments with micro-services built-in Golang, Java, Lua or something like that.
Because of my newer age, I'm not so good in team working or communicate, so those things must be hard to me.
Also, I like another things like math, history and physics.
